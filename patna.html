    <p class="intro">The city of Patna was visited the second time the STORM team travelled to India. We were hosted and guided by Pastor Sanjit Pani, who not only worked with our team to show us and connect us to as many places and people as he could, but also gave us a place to stay with his family in their home.</p>
       
       <p>
          After months of planning and excitement from the previous visit to the country, our team were eager to get back out there and make the most of our time with those who were waiting for us.  As it was a different city, and region, we were unsure of what to expect. Would it be the same as last time? Would it be like a different country all together? As it was, the difference was so vivid, and we could tell before we even landed.  
</p>
<p>
         Above the city the air was thick with smog. The ground was dark, due to lack of street lighting and the words from airport employee came to mind and rang true; “Why would you want to go to Patna? It is very poor and uneducated.” The poverty was evident. Which, as it had the first visit, made our purpose all the more clear. With poverty comes lack of security, which can only lead to abuse and attacks.   Upon this trip, we we’re guided to an inner city school that had taken up residence in a building that you just wouldn’t think of sending your children to school in.  But then, maybe the ambiguity of the building would deter potential attackers from looking for victims there.  I’d like to think so.  We also taught in a school who’s students were so small, young and venerable! Many of them hardly came to my waist in height. But they had smiles on those little faces that were bigger than any other smile and the enthusiasm to train with us was just bubbling over. </p>
<p>
We went to teach; yet we just kept learning. I feel you cannot come away from a country such as India without being humbled and enriched with life.  The children and teachers all had so much to offer, and they could absorb the information and training like sponges.  I would like to take this time to thank a few people that made our stay so much more.  Firstly, Pastor Sanjit and his family for their hospitality and guidance during our time there.  We would also like to say a big thank you to the students and teachers of Ludgvan School here in Cornwall, for helping us raise funds with a non-uniform day. The money raised was enough to buy 500+ students and teacher in the schools a samosa lunch which all were so happy to receive!  Thank you all for the part you played. </p>
