  <h2>Why STORM?</h2>
    <p class="intro">STORM, which stands for Special Team Of Role Models, was devised by Dan Tswei, when he was contacted in 2012 by an organisation in India requesting his self defence teaching for girls and women that were living in high risk areas and situations in India.  After a couple of years, planning came together and STORM were able to make their first trip over seas and teach Krav Maga self defence to the women and children that needed it. </p>
<p>
This helps to empower them, show them that they have rights, and to use their voices to stand up to their attackers and say ‘No’ when the time comes.  The lives they live, we wouldn’t wish on any of one, but in such a place as they reside, all precautions must be taken.  Threats such as kidnap, trafficking, rape, assault, chemically administrated attacks and even murder are not out of the ordinary threats for those living in India and Nepal. Places that STORM visited in 2015 to help, and make an impact for those that need the help. </p>  
<p>
STORM is in the early stages of becoming a registered charity. Currently standing as a CASC, a Community Action Sports Club. Founded in Cornwall, STORM also provide teaching close to home, taking lessons, talks, workshops and demonstrations into schools and colleges, they have a following of all ages and appreciation from all that they have taught. </p>
<p>
Krav Maga is an Israeli self-defence that is unlike any martial art. It focuses on self-preservation and teaches a mind-set that brings confidence without being arrogant and looking to show off. Those that have learned Krav Maga well, know to avoid the attack and that getting home safely is the main objective.  Now being used in over 500 police and military units world wide, it is the fasted form of self defence and used by young children in poverty stricken areas abroad, to celebrities with their own body guards in the public eye.

  <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p class="intro">The impacts we have made have only come back with feedback of positive comments and thanks. Call backs asking us to stay longer, teach more, and to keep on keeping on.  In one mere year of journeying with our team, reaching out to those who need help, we have worked with some of the most rewarding souls, those who are so eager to learn and soak up what we bring them. They have the dedication to perfect any defences we teach because they know the difference it can and will make in their day to day dangers. </p>

<p>
We teach because how can you not, when you know what is needed. The image of the hand holding a water pipe and shutting off the water to a young  dying of thirst child comes to mined. You can’t deny someone a life skill when the skill itself is teaching how to live.</p>

<p>
In out teaching we cover all ranges of attacks. From basic combat, to multiple attackers, ground fighting, sharp edge and blunt impact weapons, firearms, and even defence against acid attacks and chlorophyll. You mustn’t be alarmed reading words such as those, because for some, they are everyday language that is put in sentences of “Be careful on your walk to school, watch out for…”  This is what we do. And why we do it. And you, can be a part of this too.</p>

    <h3>India Patna</h3>
    <p>The city of Patna was visited the second time the STORM team travelled to India. We were hosted and guided by Pastor Sanjit Pani, who not only worked with our team to show us and connect us to as many places and people as he could, but also gave us a place to stay with his family in their home.</p>
